      "the men and women who make up the finest fighting force the world has ever known. But I worry if we think that the entire burden\n",

      "the rest of us can just sit back and do nothing. They can’t shoulder the entire burden. And engagement means using all the levers\n",
      "of our national power, and rallying the world to take on our shared challenges. You look at something like trade, for example. We live in an age of global supply chains,\n",

      "other countries. In this global economy, that’s not even\n",
      "possible. The answer is to do trade the right way, by\n",

      "standards; and we make sure they don’t impose unfair tariffs on American goods or steal\n",

      "debate, you might wonder where this strain of anti-intellectualism came from. So, Class of 2016, let me be as clear as I\n",

      "a virtue. It’s not cool to not know what you’re\n",
      "talking about. That’s not keeping it real, or telling it\n",
      "like it is. That’s not challenging political correctness. That’s just not knowing what you’re talking\n",
      "about. And yet, we’ve become confused about this. Look, our nation’s Founders — Franklin,\n",
      "Madison, Hamilton, Jefferson — they were born of the Enlightenment. They sought to escape superstition, and sectarianism,\n",
      "and tribalism, and no-nothingness. They believed in rational thought and experimentation,\n",
      "and the capacity of informed citizens to master our own fates. That is embedded in our constitutional design. That spirit informed our inventors and our\n",

      "during your years of college — and if not, you will learn soon — that there are a whole\n",
      "lot of folks who are book smart and have no common sense. That’s the truth. You’ll meet them if you haven’t already. So the fact that they’ve got a fancy degree\n",
      "— you got to talk to them to see whether they know what they’re talking about. Qualities like kindness and compassion, honesty,\n",
      "hard work — they often matter more than technical skills or know-how. But when our leaders express a disdain for\n",
      "facts, when they’re not held accountable for repeating falsehoods and just making stuff\n",
      "up, while actual experts are dismissed as elitists, then we’ve got a problem. You know, it’s interesting that if we get\n",
      "sick, we actually want to make sure the doctors have gone to medical school, they know what\n",
      "they’re talking about. If we get on a plane, we say we really want\n",
      "a pilot to be able to pilot the plane. And yet, in our public lives, we certainly\n",
      "think, “I don’t want somebody who’s done it before.” The rejection of facts, the rejection of reason\n",

      "who graduated high school here in New Jersey — he said: “We can judge our progress\n",
      "by the courage of our questions and the depths of our answers, our willingness to embrace\n",
      "what is true rather than what feels good.” The debate around climate change is a perfect\n",
      "example of this. Now, I recognize it doesn’t feel like the\n",
      "planet is warmer right now. I understand. There was hail when I landed in Newark. But think about the climate change issue. Every day, there are officials in high office\n",
      "with responsibilities who mock the overwhelming consensus of the world’s scientists that\n",
      "human activities and the release of carbon dioxide and methane and other substances are\n",
      "altering our climate in profound and dangerous ways. A while back, you may have seen a United States\n",
      "senator trotted out a snowball during a floor speech in the middle of winter as “proof”\n",
      "that the world was not warming. I mean, listen, climate change is not something\n",

      "senator with the snowball, what he would think. Imagine if your 5th grade science teacher\n",
      "had seen that. He’d get a D. And he’s a senator! Look, I’m not suggesting that cold analysis\n",
      "and hard data are ultimately more important in life than passion, or faith, or love, or\n",
      "loyalty. I am suggesting that those highest expressions\n",
      "of our humanity can only flourish when our economy functions well, and proposed budgets\n",
      "add up, and our environment is protected. And to accomplish those things, to make collective\n",
      "decisions on behalf of a common good, we have to use our heads. We have to agree that facts and evidence matter. And we got to hold our leaders and ourselves\n",
      "accountable to know what the heck they’re talking about. All right. I only have two more points. I know it’s getting cold and you guys have\n",
      "to graduate. Point four: Have faith in democracy. Look, I know it’s not always pretty. Really, I know. I’ve been living it. But it’s how, bit by bit, generation by\n",
      "generation, we have made progress in this nation. That’s how we banned child labor. That’s how we cleaned up our air and our\n",
      "water. That’s how we passed programs like Social\n",
      "Security and Medicare that lifted millions of seniors out of poverty. None of these changes happened overnight. They didn’t happen because some charismatic\n",

      "revolution occurred. It actually happened over the course of years\n",
      "of advocacy, and organizing, and alliance-building, and deal-making, and the changing of public\n",
      "opinion. It happened because ordinary Americans who\n",
      "cared participated in the political process. AUDIENCE MEMBER: Because of you! Well, that’s nice. I mean, I helped, but —\n",
      "Look, if you want to change this country for the better, you better start participating. I’ll give you an example on a lot of people’s\n",
      "minds right now — and that’s the growing inequality in our economy. Over much of the last century, we’ve unleashed\n",
      "the strongest economic engine the world has ever seen, but over the past few decades,\n",
      "our economy has become more and more unequal. The top 10 percent of earners now take in\n",
      "half of all income in the U.S. In the past, it used to be a top CEO made\n",
      "20 or 30 times the income of the average worker. Today, it’s 300 times more. And wages aren’t rising fast enough for\n",
      "millions of hardworking families. Now, if we want to reverse those trends, there\n",
      "are a bunch of policies that would make a real difference. We can raise the minimum wage. We can modernize our infrastructure. We can invest in early childhood education. We can make college more affordable. We can close tax loopholes on hedge fund managers\n",
      "and take that money and give tax breaks to help families with child care or retirement. And if we did these things, then we’d help\n",
      "to restore the sense that hard work is rewarded and we could build an economy that truly works\n",
      "for everybody. Now, the reason some of these things have\n",
      "not happened, even though the majority of people approve of them, is really simple. It’s not because I wasn’t proposing them. It wasn’t because the facts and the evidence\n",
      "showed they wouldn’t work. It was because a huge chunk of Americans,\n",
      "especially young people, do not vote. In 2014, voter turnout was the lowest since\n",
      "World War II. Fewer than one in five young people showed\n",
      "up to vote — 2014. And the four who stayed home determined the\n",
      "course of this country just as much as the single one who voted. Because apathy has consequences. It determines who our Congress is. It determines what policies they prioritize. It even, for example, determines whether a\n",
      "really highly qualified Supreme Court nominee receives the courtesy of a hearing and a vote\n",
      "in the United States Senate. And, yes, big money in politics is a huge\n",
      "problem. We’ve got to reduce its influence. Yes, special interests and lobbyists have\n",
      "disproportionate access to the corridors of power. But, contrary to what we hear sometimes from\n",
      "both the left as well as the right, the system isn’t as rigged as you think, and it certainly\n",
      "is not as hopeless as you think. Politicians care about being elected, and\n",
      "they especially care about being reelected. And if you vote and you elect a majority that\n",
      "represents your views, you will get what you want. And if you opt out, or stop paying attention,\n",
      "you won’t. It’s that simple. It’s not that complicated. Now, one of the reasons that people don’t\n",

      "start working. It took a proud daughter of New Jersey, Alice\n",
      "Paul, years of organizing marches and hunger strikes and protests, and drafting hundreds\n",
      "of pieces of legislation, and writing letters and giving speeches, and working with congressional\n",
      "leaders before she and other suffragettes finally helped win women the right to vote. Each stage along the way required compromise. Sometimes you took half a loaf. You forged allies. Sometimes you lost on an issue, and then you\n",
      "came back to fight another day. That’s how democracy works. So you’ve got to be committed to participating\n",
      "not just if you get immediate gratification, but you got to be a citizen full-time, all\n",
      "the time. And if participation means voting, and it\n",
